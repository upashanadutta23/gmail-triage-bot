# Gmail Cognitive Triage Agent ðŸ¤–

This project is an intelligent Python script that automatically processes unread emails from a Gmail account. It uses the Google Gemini API to understand the content and intent of each email and then takes action by integrating with other Google Workspace services like Calendar, Tasks, and Sheets.

This agent is designed to be run both locally on a personal machine or deployed in a cloud environment like Google Colab.

## Features

* **Fetches Unread Emails**: Securely connects to the Gmail API to retrieve the latest unread emails.
* **AI-Powered Intent Classification**: Uses the Gemini AI to classify each email's intent (e.g., `receipt_invoice`, `task_delegation`, `scheduling_request`).
* **Automated Data Extraction**: Extracts key information from actionable emails, such as vendor names, purchase amounts, task descriptions, and due dates.
* **Google Workspace Integration**:
    * Logs expenses from receipts directly into a specified Google Sheet.
    * Creates new tasks in Google Tasks from emails that delegate work.
    * Creates draft events in Google Calendar from scheduling requests.
* **Automatic Cleanup**: Marks emails as read after they have been processed.
